Money Spent?
============

A simple rails app to demonstrate some of my skills with ruby, rails, etc. Unfortunately my day job doesn't allow me to share the code I create, so in an effort to have some sort of "profile", I've created this app.

The idea is to create a simple app to keep track of money spent (hence the catchy name).

Goals (as of 06/21/2011)
========================

* facebook integration
* model validation
* some sort of chart
* maybe implement a view with backbone, spine, etc


 Where is it now (as of 06/27/2011)
 ==================================

 * facebook integration via omniauth
 * mongodb for persistence using mongoid
 * some form validation on the client
 * g.raphael charting populated from AJAX requests made with jQuery
 * some rspec tests (most were generated which don't work, but spec/models/expenses_spec.rb works)

 Next
 ====

 * deploy to heroku
