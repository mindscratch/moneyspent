Money Spent?
============

A simple rails app to demonstrate some of my skills with ruby, rails, etc. Unfortunately my day job doesn't allow me to share the code I create, so in an effort to have some sort of "profile", I've created this app.

The idea is to create a simple app to keep track of money spent (hence the catchy name).

Features/Goals
==============

* facebook integration
* model validation
* some sort of chart
* maybe implement a view with backbone, spine, etc
